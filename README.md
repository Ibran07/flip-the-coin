# 🪙 Flip the Coin

A simple interactive web app that flips a coin and displays the result with an animation — Heads or Tails.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The coin is represented by an `<img>` tag.
- Clicking the coin or the button triggers an `async` function.
- A CSS animation (`rotateX`) runs to simulate flipping.
